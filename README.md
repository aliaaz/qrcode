## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Experimented with clamp() and calc() and used them for the margin-block to keep the card vertically centered.

```css
.main {
  margin-block: clamp(3rem, calc((100vh - 29rem) / 2), 100em);
}
```

### Continued development

To work on how to make the CSS more robust and efficient.
